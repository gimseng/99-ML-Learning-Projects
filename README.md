# 99-ML-Learning-Projects
A list of 99 machine learning projects for anyone interested to learn machine learning from coding and building projects.

Our working philosophy is to provide a curated repo for anyone to contribute a cool/fun exercise and solution that is useful for anyone (including themselves) in their journey of learning machine learning.


## Getting Started

The format is roughly the following:

1. Propose an exercise by creating an issue ticket and write what you think is an useful coding exercise for certain concepts. 

2. If enough people are interested in that issue ticket, hopefully either you or someone else will write the exercise statement properly similar to the style of a lab exercise/homework question.

3. Then someone will fork the repo, write up their solution, with a bit of polish and documentation, submit a pull request. Please see [general contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) for more details on how to contribute solutions.

4. Some of us will scrutinize the codes, review, make suggestions and eventually include (merge) them into the main project repo.

5. At anytime, someone can repeat suggest improvements/changes to 3-4 above for a particular exercise. This is done by creating an issue ticket for improvement/enhancement. One can then repeat 3-4.

6. Finally, repeat 1-5 indefinitely till we hit 99/99 projects.

Please abide by [code of conduct guidelines](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to have an open and friendly open source collaboration.

For credits, these are the two repos (one for C and one for React) where I got the idea from:
