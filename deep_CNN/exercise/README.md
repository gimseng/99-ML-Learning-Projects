## Description
This problem deals with detecting the faults (cracks) in the SDNET dataset having concrete bridge decks, walls, and pavements images. In the proposed approach, a deep convolution neural newtork (D-CNN) is developed
for detect the faults from the Pavement images of the dataset. To deal with imablanced classes and reduce overfitting, data augmentation have also been applied before feature extraction. 


## Prerequisite

	- Computer vision concepts and knowledge of making data pipelines in Python

	- Knowledge of Convolutional Neural Network (CNNs) and Hyper-parameter Optimization for better performance.
	
	- Basic Knowledge of evaluating Deep learning models

## Evaluation Metrics

The proposed model is evaluated on the basis: Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Sensitivity, Specifcity, Precision, F-Measure.

## Future Work

1.To solve the issue of imabalanced classes, advanced resampling technqiues (random or rule-based) could be used before feature extraction. 

2.Transfer Learning methodologies can also be implemented for obtaining superior metrics of evaluation.

3.For hyper-parametr optimization, meta-heuristic technqiues (for example: Genetic algorithms) can be implemented.
