# Exercise goal
*The goal of this algorithm is to create a model that predicts the value of a target variable

# Data
 *For this project we will be exploring publicly available data from LendingClub.com. Lending Club connects people who need money (borrowers) with people who have money (investors). Hopefully, as an investor you would want to invest in people who showed a profile of having a high probability of paying you back. We will try to create a model that will help predict this. Lending club had a very interesting year in 2016, so let's check out some of their data and keep the context in mind. This data is from before they even went public.We will use lending data from 2007-2010 and be trying to classify and predict whether or not the borrower paid back their loan in full. You can download the data from here or just use the csv already provided. It's recommended you use the csv provided as it has been cleaned of NA values.


# Task
