### Solution using VGG19
Refer the following notebook Malaria_VGG16.ipynb

# My Solution

In this folder, you will find a jupyter notebook having the solution to the Malaria cell detection dataset done via Transfer Learning specifically VGG19:

`Malaria_VGG16.ipynb`


## VGG19: 

In this file, you will find a VGG19 model with pretrained imagenets weights performing the malaria cell detection task. 
This is done using Tensorflow using Keras as frontend/API
and the concept of transfer learning is used where we replace the pretarined VGG19 models 
input layer with our own input layer and retrain only the output layers.
