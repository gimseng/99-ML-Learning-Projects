## Simple neural network: 

In this file, you will find a simple 2-layer neural network approach performing the digit recognition task with an accuracy of around 98%. This is done using Tensorflow using Keras as frontend/API.


## Convolutional Neural Network (CNN):

In this file, you will find a convolutional neural network approach having multiple techniques like Batch Normalization and Dropout included to perform the digit recognition task. This is done using Tensorflow using Keras as frontend/API.
The accuracy for the same is more than 99% on test set.
