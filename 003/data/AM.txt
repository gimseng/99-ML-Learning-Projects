Arabella's got some interstellar-gator skin boots
And a Helter Skelter 'round her little finger and I ride it endlessly
She's got a Barbarella silver swimsuit
And when she needs to shelter from reality she takes a dip in my daydreams
My days end best when this sunset gets itself
Behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catching the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes
As Arabella
As Arabella
Just might have tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure
Arabella's got a seventies head
But she's a modern lover
It's an exploration, she's made of outer space
And her lips are like the galaxy's edge
And her kiss the color of a constellation falling into place
My days end best when this sunset gets itself
Behind that little lady sitting on the passenger side
It's much less picturesque without her catching the light
The horizon tries but it's just not as kind on the eyes
As Arabella
As Arabella
Just might have tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure
That's magic in a cheetah print coat
Just a slip underneath it I hope
Asking if I can have one of those
Organic cigarettes that she smokes
Wraps her lips round the Mexican coke
Makes you wish that you were the bottle
Takes a sip of your soul and it sounds like.
Just might have tapped into your mind and soul
You can't be sure
What's been happening in your world?
What have you been up to?
I heard that you fell in love
Or near enough
I gotta tell you the truth
I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it
Forever isn't for everyone
Is forever for you?
It sounds like settling down or giving up
But it don't sound much like you girl
I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (Snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it
Under a spell you're hypnotized
Darling how could you be so blind?
(Snap out of it)
Under a spell you're hypnotized
Darling how could you be so blind?
I wanna grab both your shoulders and shake baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)
I get the feeling I left it too late, but baby
Snap out of it (snap out of it)
If that watch don't continue to swing or the fat lady fancies having a sing
I'll be here waiting ever so patiently for you to
Snap out of it
You got the lights on in the afternoon
And the nights are drawn out long
And you're kissing to cut through the gloom
With a cough drop colored tongue
And you were sitting in the corner with the coats all piled high
And I thought you might be mine
In a small world on an exceptionally rainy Tuesday night
In the right place and time
When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks
Well you cured my January blues
Yeah, you made it all alright
I got a feeling I might have lit the very fuse
That you were trying not to light
You were a stranger in my phonebook I was acting like I knew
'Cause I had nothing to lose
When the winter's in full swing and your dreams just aren't coming true
Ain't it funny what you'll do
When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks
The late afternoon
The ghost in your room that you always thought didn't approve of you knocking boots
Never stopped you letting me get hold of the sweet spot by the scruff of your
Knee socks
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby
You and me could have been a team (all the zeros lined up)
Each had a half of a king and queen seat
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby (but the number was blocked)
You and me could have been a team
Each had a half of a king and queen seat (when you've come undone)
Like the beginning of Mean Streets
You could be my baby
When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks
When the zeros line up on the 24 hour clock
When you know who's calling even though the number is blocked
When you walked around your house wearing my sky blue Lacoste
And your knee socks
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs
Stop and wait a sec
Oh, when you look at me like that, my darling
What did you expect?
I probably still adore you with your hands around my neck
Or I did last time I checked
Not shy of a spark
A knife twists at the thought that I should fall short of the mark
Frightened by the bite though it's no harsher than the bark
Middle of adventure, such a perfect place to start
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs
But I crumble completely when you cry
It seems like once again you've had to greet me with goodbye
I'm always just about to go and spoil a surprise
Take my hands off of your eyes too soon
I'm going back to 505
If it's a seven hour flight or a forty-five minute drive
In my imagination you're waiting, lying on your side
With your hands between your thighs and a smile!
I'm a puppet on a string
Tracy Island, time-traveling
Diamond cutter-shaped heartaches
Come to find you four in some velvet morning
Years too late, she's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine?
Are you mine?
Are you mine? Oh, ah
I guess what I'm tryna say is I need the deep end
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
Great escape, lost track of time and space
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire
And I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine? (are you mine tomorrow?)
Are you mine? (or just mine tonight?)
Are you mine? (are you mine, mine?)
And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
So in case, I'm mistaken, I
Just wanna hear you say, "You got me, baby
Are you mine?"
She's a silver lining
Lone ranger riding through an open space
In my mind when she's not right there beside me
I go crazy 'cause here isn't where I wanna be
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
And I can't help myself, all I
Wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
Well, are you mine? 
Are you mine? 
Are you mine? 
Or just mine tonight?
One for the road, ooh ooh
One for the road, ooh ooh
From the bottom of your heart
The relegation zone
I saw this coming from the start
The shake, rattle and roll
The cracks in blackout blinds
Cast patterns on the ceiling but you're feeling fine
I thought it was dark outside
I thought it was dark outside
So we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me round baby, I feel like I've been in here before
I've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?
I knew this would be on the cards
I knew you wouldn't fold
I saw this coming from the start
The shake, rattle and roll
One for the road, ooh ooh
So we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me round baby, I feel like I've been in here before
I've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?
The mixture hits you hard
Don't get that sinking feeling, don't fall apart
Some out of tune guitar
Soundtrack to disaster
Ooh ooh, one for the road
Ooh ooh, one for the road
Ooh ooh, one for the road
Ooh ooh, one for the road
So we all go back to yours and you sit and talk to me on the floor
There's no need to show me round baby, I feel like I've been in here before
I've been wondering whether later when you tell everybody to go
Will you pour me one for the road?
You used to get it in your fishnets
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
Landed in a very common crisis
Everythin's in order in a black hole
Nothin' seems as pretty as the past though
That Bloody Mary's lackin' in Tabasco
Remember when you used to be a rascal?
Oh, the boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
Not as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seem, my love, when you dream them up
Flickin' through a little book of sex tips
Remember when the boys were all electric?
Now when she's told she's gonna get it
I'm guessin' that she'd rather just forget it
Clingin' to not gettin' sentimental
Said she wasn't goin' but she went still
Likes her gentlemen not to be gentle
Was it a Mecca dauber or a bettin' pencil?
Oh, the boy's a slag
The best you ever had
The best you ever had is just a memory and those dreams
Weren't as daft as they seem
Not as daft as they seem, my love, when you dream them up
Oh, Flo, where did you go?
Where did you go?
Where did you go, oh
You're fallin' about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
You were just soundin' it out
But you're not comin' back again
You're fallin' about
You took a left off Last Laugh Lane
You were just soundin' it out
But you're not comin' back again
You used to get it in your fishnets
fallin' about
Now you only get it in your night dress
Discarded all the naughty nights for niceness
you took a left off Last Laugh Lane
Landed in a very common crisis
Everythin's in order in a black hole
Nothin' seems as pretty as the past though
you were just soundin' it out
That Bloody Mary's lackin' in Tabasco 
you're not comin' back again
Remember when you used to be a rascal?
Well, now then, mardy bum
I've seen your frown and it's like looking down
The barrel of a gun
And it goes off
And out come all these words
Oh, there's a very pleasant side to you
A side I much prefer
It's one that laughs and jokes around
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on
Well, now then, mardy bum
Oh, I'm in trouble again, aren't I?
I thought as much
'Cause you turned over there
Pulling that silent disappointment face
The one that I can't bare
Well, can't we just laugh and joke around?
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on
And, yeah, I'm sorry I was late
But I missed the train
And then the traffic was a state
And I can't be arsed to carry on in this debate
That reoccurs, oh, when you say I don't care
But, of course I do, yeah, I clearly do
So laugh and joke around?
Remember cuddles in the kitchen, yeah
To get things off the ground
And it was up, up and away
Oh, but it's right hard to remember that
On a day like today
When you're all argumentative
And you've got the face on
Said, who's that girl there?
I wonder what went wrong
So that she had to roam the streets
She don't do major credit cards
I doubt she does receipts
It's all not quite legitimate
And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes, yeah
That he's got a driving ban
Amongst some other offences
And I've seen him with girls of the night
And he told Roxanne to put on her red light
They're all infected but he'll be alright
'Cause he's a scumbag, don't you know?
I said, he's a scumbag, don't you know?
Although you're trying not to listen
Avert your eyes and staring at the ground
She makes a subtle proposition
"I'm sorry, love, I'll have to turn you down"
And oh, he must be up to summat
What are the chances? Sure it's more than likely
I've got a feeling in my stomach
And start to wonder what his story might be
What his story might be, yeah
'Cause they said it changes when the sun goes down
Yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here, around here, oh
And look here comes a Ford Mondeo
Isn't he Mister Inconspicuous?
And he don't have to say 'owt
She's in the stance ready to get picked up
Bet she's delighted when she sees him
Pulling in and giving her the eye
Because she must be fucking freezing
Scantily-clad beneath the clear night sky
And don't stop in the winter, no
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Yeah, they said it changes when the sun goes down
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here
Well, they said it changes when the sun goes down
Over the river, going out of town
And they said it changes when the sun goes down
Around here, around here, oh
And what a scummy man
Just give him half a chance
I bet he'll rob you if he can
Can see it in his eyes, yeah, that he's got a nasty plan
I hope you're not involved at all
I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathing in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I will never rust
If you like your coffee hot
Let me be your coffee pot
You call the shots babe
I just wanna be yours
Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours
Let me be your 'leccy meter and I'll never run out
And let me be the portable heater that you'll get cold without
I wanna be your setting lotion (I wanna be)
Hold your hair in deep devotion (how deep?)
At least as deep as the Pacific Ocean
I wanna be yours
Secrets I have held in my heart
Are harder to hide than I thought
Maybe I just wanna be yours
I wanna be yours, I wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours
Wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours, wanna be yours
I wanna be your vacuum cleaner
Breathing in your dust
I wanna be your Ford Cortina
I will never rust
I just wanna be yours
Stop making the eyes at me
I'll stop making the eyes at you
What it is that surprises me
Is that I don't really want you to
And your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
Oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
And lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh
I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said, I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Well, from 1984
I wish you'd stop ignoring me
Because you're sending me to despair
Without a sound, yeah, you're calling me
And I don't think it's very fair
That your shoulders are frozen (cold as the night)
Oh, but you're an explosion (you're dynamite)
Your name isn't Rio, but I don't care for sand
And lighting the fuse might result in a bang, b-b-bang-oh
I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said, I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Well, from 1984
Oh, there ain't no love, no Montagues or Capulets
Just banging tunes and DJ sets and
Dirty dance floors and dreams of naughtiness!
Well, I bet that you look good on the dance floor
I don't know if you're looking for romance or
I don't know what you're looking for
I said, I bet that you look good on the dance floor
Dancing to electro-pop like a robot from 1984
Said, from 1984
Well, oh, they might wear classic Reeboks
Or knackered Converse
Or tracky bottoms tucked in socks
But all of that's what the point is not
The point's that there ain't no romance around there
And there's the truth that they can't see
They'd probably like to throw a punch at me
And if you could only see 'em, then you would agree
Agree that there ain't no romance around there
You know, oh, it's a funny thing you know
We'll tell 'em if you like
We'll tell 'em all tonight
They'll never listen
Because their minds are made up
And course it's all okay to carry on that way
'Cause over there, there's broken bones
There's only music, so that there's new ringtones
And it don't take no Sherlock Holmes
To see it's a little different around here
Don't get me wrong, though, there's boys in bands
And kids who like to scrap with pool cues in their hands
And just 'cause he's had a couple o' cans
He thinks it's all right to act like a dickhead
Don't you know, oh' it's a funny thing you know
We'll tell 'em if you like
We'll tell 'em all tonight
They'll never listen
Because their minds are made up
And course it's all okay to carry on that way
But I said no
Oh no
Well, you won't get me to go
Not anywhere, not anywhere
No, I won't go
Oh no no
Well, over there, there's friends of mine
What can I say? I've known 'em for a long long time
And, yeah, they might overstep the line
But you just cannot get angry in the same way
No, not in the same way
Said, not in the same way
Oh no, oh no no
Advertise in imaginative ways
Start your free trial today
Come on in, the water's lovely
Look, you could meet someone you like
During the meteor strike
It is that easy
Lunar surface on a Saturday night
Dressed up in silver and white
With coloured old grey whistle test lights
Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us
It's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
Since the exodus it's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the roof
It was well reviewed
Four stars out of five
And that's unheard of
I'm Mr. Bridge and Tunnel on the Starlight Express
The head of special effects in my mind's eye
Okey cokey with the opposite sex
The things you try to forget
Doesn't time fly?
I'm in no position to give advice
I don't want to be nice
And you know that
Take it easy for a little while
Come and stay with us
It's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep popping up
Around Clavius
It's all getting gentrified
The information action ratio
Is the place to go
And you will not recognize
The old headquarters
All the nights that never happened
And the days that don't exist
At the information action ratio
Only time that we stop laughing
Is to breathe or steal a kiss
I can get you on the list for all the clubs
I can lift you up another semitone
Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us
It's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
(Cute new places keep on popping up)
Since the exodus, it's all getting gentrified
The information action ratio
(The information action ratio) is the place to go
Four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us
Now, it's such an easy flight
Cute new places keep on popping up
(Cute new places keep on popping up)
Around Clavius, it's all getting gentrified
I put a taqueria on the moon
(The information action ratio)
It got rave reviews
Four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us
Four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us
Four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us
Four stars out of five
Take it easy for a little while
(Take it easy for a little while)
Come and stay with us
(Four stars out of five)
(Take it easy for a little while)
Four stars out of five
I thought I saw you in the battleship
But it was only a look a like
She was nothing but a vision trick
Under the warning light
She was close, close enough to be your ghost
But my chances turned to toast
When I asked her if I could call her your name
I thought I saw you in the rusty hook
Huddled up in wicker chair
I wandered up for a closer look
And kissed who ever was sitting there
She was close, and she held me very tightly
'Til I asked awfully politely, please
Can I call you her name
And I elongated my lift home,
Yeah I let him go the long way round
I smelt your scent on the seat belt
And kept my shortcuts to myself
I thought I saw you in the parrots beak
Messing with the smoke alarm
It was too loud for me to hear her speak
And she had a broken arm
It was close, so close that the walls were wet
And she wrote it out in letraset
No you can't call me her name
Tell me where's your hiding place
I'm worried I'll forget your face
And I've asked everyone
I'm beginning to think I imagined you all along
I elongated my lift home
Yeah I let him go the long way 'round
I smelt your scent on the seat belt
And kept my shortcuts to myself
I saw your sister in the cornerstone
On the phone to the middle man
When I saw that she was on her own
I thought she might understand
She was close, well you couldn't get much closer
She said I'm really not supposed to but yes,
You can call me anything you want
Fools on parade cavort and carry on
For waiting eyes
That you would rather be beside than in front of
But she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares
She swam out of tonight's phantasm
Grabbed my hand and made it very clear
There's absolutely nothing for us here
It's a magnolia celebration
To be attempted on a Wednesday night
It's better than to get a reputation
As a miserable little tyke
At least that's the conclusion
She came to in this overture
The secret door swings behind us
She's saying nothing
She's just giggling along
Her arms were folded most indignant
Not looking like she was soon to leave
I had to squint in order to believe
And then like a butler pushing on a bookshelf
I'm unveiling the unexpected
How she was never gonna look to?
Suddenly embarrassed and corrected
How could such a creature
Survive in such a habitat
The secret door swings behind us
She's saying nothing
She's just giggling along
And even if they were to find us
I wouldn't notice, I'm completely occupied
At all the fools on parade
Cavort and carry on for waiting eyes
That you would rather be beside than in front of
But she's never been the kind
To be hollowed by the stares
Fools on parade
Frolic and fuck about to make her gaze
Turn to a scribble on a page by a picture
That holds her options
But you're daft to think she'd care
Fools on parade
Fools on parade
Fools on parade
Conduct a sing-along
Old yellow bricks
Love's a risk
Quite the little 'escapologist'
Looked so miffed
When you wished
For a thousand places better than this
You are the fugitive
But you don't know what you're runnin' from
You can't kid us
And you couldn't trick anyone
Houdini, love you don't know what you're runnin' away from
Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia
Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
She wasn't raged but the way
That the emperor put traps in the cage
And the days she been dull
Lead to nights readin' beer bottles
You're such a fugitive
But you don't know what you're runnin' from
You can't kid us
And you couldn't trick anyone
Houdini, love you don't know what you're runnin' away from
Who wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up?
Blinded by nostalgia
Who wants to sleep in a city that never wakes up?
You're at a loss
Just because
It wasn't all that you thought it was
You are a fugitive, but you don't know what you're runnin' away from
She said, "I want to sleep in the city that never wakes up
And revel in nostalgia."
I know I said he wants to sleep in the city that never wakes up, but
Dorothy was right though
Do you still feel younger than you thought you would by now
Or, darling, have you started feeling old yet
Don't worry, I'm sure that you're still breaking hearts
With the efficiency that only youth can harness
And do you still think love is a Laserquest
Or do you take it all more seriously
I've tried to ask you this in some daydreams that I've had
But you're always busy being make-believe
And do you look into the mirror to remind yourself you're there
Or have somebody's good-night kisses got that covered
Well I'm not being honest, I'll pretend that you were just some lover
Now I can't think of air without thinking of you
I doubt that comes as a surprise
And I can't think of anything to dream about
I can't find anywhere to hide
And when I'm hanging on by the rings around my eyes
And I convince myself I need another
And for a minute it gets easier to pretend that you were just some lover
When I'm pipe and slippers and rocking chair
Singing dreadful songs about something
Well I've found a better method of pretending you were just some lover
Well I've found a better method of pretending you were just some lover
Brian
Top marks for not trying
So kind of you to bless us
With your effortlessness
We're grateful and so strangely comforted
And I wonder
Are you putting us under
'Cause we can't take our eyes
Off the t-shirt and ties combination?
Well, see you later, innovator
Some want to kiss, some want to kick you
There's not a net you couldn't slip through
Or at least that's the impression I get
'Cause you're smooth, and you're wet
And she's not aware yet
But she's yours
She'll be saying, "use me
Show me the jacuzzi"
I imagine that it's there on a plate
Your whole rendezvous rate
Means that you'll never be frightened
To make them wait for a while
I doubt it's your style
Not to get what you set
Out to acquire, the eyes are on fire
You are the unforecasted storm
calm, collected and commanding
(Top marks for not trying)
You leave the other stories standing
With your renditions and jokes
Bet there's hundreds of blokes
That have wept 'cause you've stolen their
Thunder
Are you putting us under
'Cause we can't take our eyes
Off the t-shirt and ties combination?
Well, see you later, innovator
Fools on parade cavort and carry on
For waiting eyes
That you would rather be beside than in front of
But she's never been the kind to be hollowed by the stares

But you're daft to think she'd care
Fools on parade
Fools on parade
Fools on parade
Conduct a sing-along
Open Sesame (we've places to go)
We've people to see (let's put 'em on hold)
There's all sorts of shapes, that I bet you can make
When you want to escape, say the word
Well, I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
With the exception of you I dislike everyone in the room
And I don't wanna lie, but I don't wanna tell you the truth
Get the sense that you're on the move
And you'll probably be leaving soon, so I'm telling you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off, with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off, with you
Eyes the color of (water left in mud)
Icing sugar dust (crazy green flashes)
It's a funny thing, that I cannot explain
Don't you know the train keeps a-rolling?
Stop the world cause I wanna
Get off, with you
Stop the world cause I wanna
Get off, with you
Well, I know that getting you alone isn't easy to do
And I don't wanna lie, and I don't wanna tell you the truth
And I know we got places to go, we got people to see
Think we both oughta put 'em on hold and I know you agree
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off, with you
Stop the world 'cause I wanna
Get off, with you
I heard the truth was built to bend
A mechanism to suspend the guilt
Is what you are requiring still
You've got to dance little liar
Just like those fibbs that pop and fizz
And you'll be forced to take that awful quiz
And you're bound to trip
And she'll detect the fiction on
Your lips and dig a contradiction up
And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt beneath the dirt
The liar take a lot less time
I'm sure it's clear and plain to me
Its not an alibi you need just yet
Oh no it's something for those beads of sweat
Yes that we'll get you back to normal
And after you have dabbed the patch you'll grieve
And then proceed to scratch the varnish off
That newly added calmness
So as not to raise any alarms too soon
And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt beneath the dirt
The liar takes a lot less
Time to decide on his saunter
Have you got itchy bones
And in all your time alone
Can you hack your mind being riddled
With the wrong memories
And the clean coming will hurt
And you can never get it spotless
When there's dirt between the dirt
I can't explain but I want to try
There's this image of you and I
And it goes dancing by in the morning and in the night time
There's all these secrets that I can't keep
Like in my heart there's that hotel suite and you lived there so long
It's kinda strange now you're gone
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good?
Or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind?
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside
There's all those places we used to go
And I suspect you already know
But that place on memory lane you liked still looks the same
But something about it's changed
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good?
Or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind?
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside
And I thought I was yours forever
Maybe I was mistaken but I just cannot manage to make it through the day
Without thinking of you lately
I'm not sure if I should show you what I've found
Has it gone for good?
Or is it coming back around?
Isn't it hard to make up your mind?
When you're losing and your fuse is fireside
A pussyfooting setting sun
Make a wish that weighs a ton
There are no handles for you to hold
And no understanding where it goes
Jealously in Technicolor
Fear by name, love by numbers
Street lamp amber, wanderlust
Hide her in a blunderbus
She looks as if she's blowing at kiss at me
And suddenly the sky is a scissor
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
Crushing up a bundle of love
Don't take it so personally
You're not the only one
That time has got it in for honey
That's where you're wrong
All the old flames fastened on
Make a wish that weighs a ton
There are no handles that you can hold
And no understanding where it goes
She looks as if she's blowing a kiss at me
And suddenly the sky is a scissor
Sitting on the floor with a tambourine
Crushing up a bundle of love
Don't take it so personally
You're not the only one,
That time has got it in for honey
That's where you're wrong
Tricking through the morning,
The tramp with the trampoline under his arm,
Shifts past your whiskers,
So spark is a charm with the barking alarm,
Weighs coil 'til the corner is turned.
And the bicycle wheels, all struggle to move round,
In your muddy mind,
Blatantly cape town,
And will intertwine in co-operative time,
Shall we sit on the springs 'til the mung goes dry?
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall,
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the
What came first the chicken or the dickhead?
Split sleep reeps through rewards and ill fitting thoughts,
A twilight force, she doesn't wanna walk,
Your legs start running and your head gets caught,
Cannot be nineteen, it's perfectly placed for the reasonably frightening,
Pulled from the after taste, you'll have to slip away,
And I'm happy to say,
Behold as the crook in a hammock plays
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall,
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall
Behold as the crook in the hammock plays,
Crawling with the base of the scales,
And fiddles with the feet on a balancing act,
Gagged, bound and craft in a tale,
Trailing wrapped in a gasp,
Crawling with the base of the scales,
And fucking fiddles with the feet on a balancing act,
You were gagged, bound and craft in a tale,
Trailing wrapped in a gasp.
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall,
All the pretty visitors came and waved their arms
And cast the shadow of a snake pit on the wall.
Dancing in my underpants
I'm gonna run for government
I'm gonna form a covers band and all
And back there by the baby grand
Did Mr. Winter Wonderland say
"Come here, kid, we really need to talk"?
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought
I fantasize, I call it quits
I swim with the economists
And I get to the bottom of it for good
By the time reality hits
The chimes of freedom fell to bits
The shining city on the fritz
They come out of the cracks
Thirsty for blood
Just as the apocalypse finally gets prioritized
And you cried some of the hottest tears you ever cried
Multiplied by five
I suppose the singer must die
Singsong 'round the money tree
This stunning documentary
That no one else unfortunately saw
Such beautiful photography
It's worth it for the opening scene
I've been driving 'round listening to the score
Or maybe, I just imagined it all
I've played to quiet rooms like this before
Bear with me, man, I lost my train of thought
You showed me my tomorrow
Beside a box of matches
A welcome threatening stir
My hopes of being stolen
Might just ring true
Depends who you prefer
But if it's true you're gonna run away
Tell me where
I'll meet you there
Am I snapping the excitement
If I pack away the laugther
And tell you how it feels
And does burden come to meet ya
If I've questions of the feature that runs on your dream wheel
The day after you stole my heart,
Everything I touched told me it would be better shared with you
With you
And now you're hiding in my sleep
And the book reveals your face
And there's a splashing in my eyelids
As the concentration continually breaks
I did request the mark you cast
Didn't heal as fast
I hear your voice in silences
Will the teasing of the fire be followed by the thud?
And the jostling crowd
You're not allowed to tell the truth
And the photo booth's a liar
And the sharpened explanation
But there's no screaming reason to inquire
I'd like to poke them in their prying eyes
With things they never see if it smacked them in their temples
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
I've been feeling foolish
You should try it
She came and substituted
The peace and quiet
For acrobatic blood
Flow constanting her?
Her cheating heartbeat
Rapid fire
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
Hear who's your host
Sounds as if she's pretty close
When the heat starts growing horns
She's thunderstorms
She's been loop-the-looping
Around my mind
Her motorcycle boots
Give me this kind of
Acrobatic blood?
Constanting her?
Cheating heartbeat
Rapid fire
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
In an unusual place
When you're feeling far away
She does what the night does to the day
She's thunderstorms
Lying on her front
Up against the wall
She's thunderstorms
