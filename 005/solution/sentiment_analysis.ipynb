I was so in the moment with Broken World and hurt with Mia because she was surrounded by people but so alone and I understood her feelings.  I found myself wishing I could give her some of my courage and strength or even just to be there for her.

This first book in her new Hope series does not disappoint either.This is the story of Emma, a new vet who has come back home to open her own practice and Luke McCormack, a police officer in the same town.Both have been previously burned by love so both have issues but, that doesn't stop them from acting on that attraction.This book pulls you in from the first page, wraps you up and doesn't let you go until the end.I loved it!\n"
