# Leaf Disease Segmentation

 As the increase in the application of artificial intelligence machines are able to produce or assist the human to take future steps in right time with accurate and precise manner. Monitoring of plant health and providing good amount of nutrients on right time is challenging for a large field where farmers have to manually look after the plants. But, by the use of AI it could be easy and less time consuming to monitor large field. Here comes the use of computer vision which search the plants or leafs which are vulnerable and provide this information to the user and then user take necessary action related to the disease. Here in this project I have used image segementation which segments the disease portion from the leafs.
 
 # Data
 
 For this project approximately 600 color images of differnt plants are used.
 *  Annotation of these images are done using [Labelme](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme)
 *  Datasets are created from annotated json file
 *  Data augmentation is done using [albumentations](https://github.com/albumentations-team/albumentations) library
