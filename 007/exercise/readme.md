## Data set and goals
Uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition and explore important questions such as ‘show me a breakdown of distance from home by job role and attrition’ or ‘compare average monthly income by education and attrition’. This is a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists.

Data path: `../data/employee_attrition.csv`

Data source: [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/pavansubhasht/ibm-hr-analytics-attrition-dataset)



Implement different data-preprocessing techniques, feature extraction techniques and machine learning models. This is a supervised classification problem.

A few example solutions:
1) Logistic Regression
2) Random Forest Classifier
3) SVM Classifier
4) Decision Tree
5) K-Means
6) Gradient Boosting (XGBoost, CatBoost)
7) Neural networks 
8) Other

## Suggestions/guides:

We will have a model performance comparison table, so it is best to standardise metric/measures as well as some performance measurement practices. 

- Please use train/test split ratio of 80/20. Random seeds could be anything, they should not matter.

- Please provide the full confusion marix and F1 score.

- Feel free to tune and work on as many models as you want offline. When submitting PR, please check in the issue ticket [#99](https://github.com/gimseng/99-ML-Learning-Projects/issues/98) to see if the models have been submitted before. If you feel that you substantially improve the same model, feel free to discuss in the issue ticket and we should either modify the submitted model or replaced it.
