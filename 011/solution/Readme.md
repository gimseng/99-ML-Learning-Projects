1. **Project Title:** Start with a clear and descriptive title for your project.

   Example:
   **Twitter Sentiment Analysis using Naive Bayes Classifier**

2. **Project Description:** Provide a brief overview of what the project does and what problem it aims to solve.

   Example:
   This project uses a Naive Bayes classifier to perform sentiment analysis on Twitter data. It predicts the sentiment (Positive, Neutral, Negative, or Irrelevant) of tweets based on their text.

3. **Installation:**
   - List the dependencies and libraries used in your project.
   - Include instructions on how to install or set up the project, including any dataset or model files needed.

   Example:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn
   ```

4. **Usage:**
   - Explain how to use your project. Provide code examples and explain the inputs and outputs.
   - Include the code for training and using the sentiment analysis model.

   Example:
   ```python
   # Import necessary libraries
   import pandas as pd
   from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
   from sklearn.naive_bayes import MultinomialNB

   # Load and preprocess the data
   # ...

   # Train the model
   model = MultinomialNB()
   model.fit(X_train_count, y_train)

   # Perform sentiment analysis
   sentiments = ["Example tweet 1", "Example tweet 2"]
   sentiments_count = v.transform(sentiments)
   predictions = model.predict(sentiments_count)
   ```

5. **Data Description:** Explain the format and structure of the dataset used. Mention the columns and their meanings.

   Example:
   - The dataset contains columns: "sentiment" and "result".
   - "sentiment" contains the text of tweets, and "result" contains the sentiment labels (0 for Neutral, 1 for Positive, 2 for Negative, and 3 for Irrelevant).

6. **Results:** Discuss the results of your project. Include any metrics or evaluations if applicable. In your case, you've used the `model.score()` method to evaluate the model's performance.

   Example:
   The model achieved an accuracy score of X% on the test data, indicating its performance in classifying sentiment.

7. **Contributing:** Provide guidelines for contributing to your project if you want others to contribute.

   Example:
   We welcome contributions from the community. If you would like to contribute to this project, please follow the guidelines in our CONTRIBUTING.md file.

8. **Authors:** Mention the authors or contributors of the project.

   Example:
   - Author: [Adarsh Kesharwani]

9. **Acknowledgments:** You can thank or acknowledge anyone or any resources that helped you in the project.

   Example:
   Special thanks to [Name] for their guidance and support during the project.

10. **Contact Information:** Provide a way for users to contact you if they have questions or issues.

   Example:
