**Learning Goals**:
- Learn how to perform sentiment analysis using a Naive Bayes classifier.
- Understand the concept of preprocessing text data for machine learning.
- Explore the use of scikit-learn libraries for text classification.

**Exercise Statement**:
In this exercise, you will apply a Naive Bayes classifier to perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of Twitter data. The goal is to predict the sentiment of tweets as Positive, Neutral, Negative, or Irrelevant based on the text content of the tweets.

**Prerequisites**:
- Basic understanding of Python programming.
- Familiarity with machine learning concepts.
- Knowledge of scikit-learn library.

**Data source/summary**:
The dataset used in this exercise contains Twitter data with sentiment labels. The data consists of tweets along with their associated sentiment, which can be one of four categories: Positive, Neutral, Negative, or Irrelevant.

The dataset source is not specified in the code, but it is assumed to be provided in two CSV files: "twitter_training.csv" and "twitter_validation.csv."

**Suggest/Propose Solutions**:
This exercise uses a Naive Bayes classifier and scikit-learn for sentiment analysis. While the solution is outlined in the code provided, additional details and explanations could be added to make the exercise more comprehensive.
