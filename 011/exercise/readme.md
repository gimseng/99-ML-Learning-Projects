# Problem Statement

The data is described in [./data/Readme.txt](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/xuwil/99-ML-Learning-Projects/master/011/data/Readme.txt). This dataset has discrete values for how many people rent bikes per hour. We would like to estimate this value using a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).
The aim of the exercise is to familiarize the reader with the bases of data cleaning and selection, and to understand the fundations of MLPs.
This exercise will use only numpy and pandas so that the process is clear.

# Objective

To understand how Multi-layer Perceptrons works internally as well as the general approach to building a machine learning model.

# Task

- Understand and execute the common steps of data preprocessing. 
- Understand the theory behind and build a simple multi-layer perceptron.
- Understand and implement the backpropagation algorithm.
- Implement training loop.
- Perform hyperparameters tuning to find the optimal model.
