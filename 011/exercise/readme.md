# Problem Statement

The aim of the exercise is to implement k-NN from scratch.
Basic implementation can be found in folder 010

# Objective

To understand how to predict using kNN.

# Task

You will be given a excel sheet with ages of people (Cloumn 1) and their salary(Cloumn 2).
You will need to find weather he/she wil buy a car (Yes - 1 , No - 0)(Cloumn 3)
Kindly refer excel sheet attached.

# k-NN Algorithm

K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a type of supervised ML algorithm which can be used for both classification as well as regression predictive problems.

K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm uses ‘feature similarity’ to predict the values of new datapoints which further means that the new data point will be assigned a value based on how closely it matches the points in the training set.

Use your own skills and use your own ability to solve the problem.ss
