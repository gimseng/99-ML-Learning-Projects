### Case Study: Electric Motorcycle Battery Swap Fraud Analysis

**Introduction:**

This exercise entails analyzing a dataset from a battery swap service operating across different stations in a city. The goal is to detect potential fraudulent activities within the swap data to address revenue losses.

**Objectives:**

- Identify inconsistencies in the dataset indicative of fraudulent activities.
- Propose additional data points for enhanced fraud detection.
- Develop automated methods for real-time fraud detection and alert generation.

**Dataset Overview:**

The dataset comprises the following information for each swap:

- Date and time of swap
- Station location
- Swapper's identity
- IDs of received and returned batteries
- Associated bike information
- Client paying for the swap
- Charger used
- Client ID involved in the transaction
- Gauge readings at swap start and end

**Approach:**

- **Data Exploration**: Examine distributions and relationships between variables to spot anomalies.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Utilize descriptive statistics to identify outliers and unusual patterns.
- **Machine Learning**: Employ anomaly detection algorithms such as Isolation Forest or One-Class SVM.
- **SQL Queries**: Execute queries to detect irregularities and inconsistencies within the dataset.

**Additional Data Points for Fraud Detection:**

1. Location-based data to detect swaps occurring in unusual or unauthorized areas.
2. Historical swap patterns of clients and stations for anomaly detection.
3. Transaction timestamps to identify suspicious activity during non-operational hours.

**Automated Fraud Detection:**

- Implement scheduled scripts to run anomaly detection algorithms on new data regularly.
- Utilize triggers in SQL databases to generate alerts for suspicious transactions in real-time.

By combining statistical analysis, machine learning techniques, and SQL queries, we can effectively identify and flag fraudulent activities within the battery swap dataset, mitigating revenue losses and ensuring operational integrity.
