# Exercise goal
- Learn the concept of Reinforcement learning by solving the cartpole player problem with the use of OpenAI gym.

# Data
- Using the cartpole player from OpenAI gym. [Link](https://gym.openai.com/docs/)

# Task
- This exercise helps in learning reinforcement learning using 3 approaches. 
- First, using random playing strategy multiple times and saving parameters for the best average episode. 
- Second, playing multiple times and updating the weights which leads to best optimum time.
- Third, using Deep Q-Learning strategy to optimize the parameters, left and right actions per se for various frames.

# Prerequisites
- Must have experience with basic Deep Learning using Tensorflow.
