# Problem Statement

The aim of the exercise is to implement K-Means Clustering from scratch.
The basic implementation is done for understanding.

# Objective

To understand how k-means works internally.

# Task

This input file contains the basic information (ID, age, gender, income, spending score) about the customers of a mall. Spending Score is something you assign to the customer based on your defined parameters like customer behavior and purchasing data.

# K-Means Algorithm
